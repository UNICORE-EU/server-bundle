README for demo certificates
============================

Each server component requires its own X509 certificate
(this is optional for the TSI). To allow quick evaluation of
UNICORE, the server bundle comes with a full set of demo certificates.

This directory contains 

 - the Demo CA certificate: trusted/cacert.pem
 - credentials in unencrypted PEM format for all Java servers
 - credential in pem format for the optional uftpd server

PLEASE DO NOT use these certs for a public server!
