README for demo certificates
============================

Each server component requires its own X509 certificate
(this is optional for the TSI). To allow quick evaluation of
UNICORE, the server bundle comes with a full set of demo certificates.

This directory contains 

 - the Demo CA certificate trusted/cacert.pem
 - keystores in pkcs12 format for all Java servers
 - keystore in pem format for the optional uftpd server
 - a "demo user" keystore (password "the!user") in pkcs12 format

PLEASE DO NOT use these certs for a public server!
