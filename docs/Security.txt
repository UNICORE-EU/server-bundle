SECURITY NOTES
**************

The Gateway, UNICORE/X, Registry, Workflow and XUUDB servers use X.509
certificates and client-authenticated SSL for communication. The
default certificates should not be used if your servers are accessible
from the internet!

This text describes *very briefly* how to exchange the server certificates for 
"real" production certificates.

Content:

1. General notes
2. Gateway
3. UNICORE/X, Workflow
4. Registry
5. XUUDB


For each component, we give an overview of the security settings for the
component, list the relevant configuration files, and list the required
certificates that the component needs to trust.

Please note that this is *not* a general introduction to UNICORE security, 
X509 public key infrastructure, etc.


General notes
*************

The components can use pkcs12, jks and pem keystores. There are many tools 
to create and edit keystores, for example:

 - OpenSSL
 - Portecle, a Java-based GUI application available from 
   http://portecle.sourceforge.net
 - The "keytool" command from the Java runtime environment

All components usually have 
 - a keystore containing one (or more) private keys and the corresponding
 public key
 - a truststore containing the trusted certificates, notably the certificate
 of the certification authority that the component trusts

It is a good approach to use a common truststore and share it between
the servers. The most convenient truststore is a directory containing the
trusted CA certs in pem format. Each server should have its own
private key in a keystore file.


Gateway
*******

Overview:

The Gateway is a service that is contacted by both end users and servers 
(i.e. potentially all servers in the federation except the XUUDB).

The Gateway also acts as client towards UNICORE/X, Registry and Workflow
servers.

Relevant configuration files:

The keystore/truststore location and password is configured in 
"gateway/conf/gateway.properties"

The truststore must contain the CA certificates of *all servers*
(UNICORE/X, Registry, Workflow, ...) that are accessed via the Gateway
(listed in gateway/conf/connections.properties).


IF SSL CLIENT AUTHENTICATION IS ENABLED (by default, this is NOT the case)
the truststore must contain also CA certificates of *all* user and server
certificates that are allowed to connect to the gateway.


UNICORE/X & Workflow
********************

Overview:

The UNICORE/X and Workflow servers are usually *not* contacted
directly by users or other UNICORE/X servers, only via the Gateway.
However, making outgoing connections (data staging, Unity
authentication etc) require that UNICORE/X has the trusted CAs of all
relevant server certificates in its truststore.

Relevant configuration files:

The keystore/truststore is configured in 
"../conf/container.properties" (or "main.config")

Required Truststore content:

 - CA certificates of *all* server certificates that are to be trusted

Trusted assertion issuers:
 (only if validation is enabled, see manual)
 - the public keys of all trusted Unity servers

Registry
********

All comments made for the UNICORE/X component apply to the Registry as well.

***
*** In addition, please note the following: 
***
In a production environment, it MUST be controlled who is allowed to
write to the Registry. This is achieved by explicitely adding the
certificates / DNs of all valid servers with role="server" to the
XUUDB (or other attribute source used by the Registry).
Access control is enabled by default and MUST NOT be switched off.
If anybody is allowed to write, a malicious user could add a server
entry and try to use any trust delegation sent to this malicious
server to compromise user data.

XUUDB
*****

The XUUDB server is contacted by each UNICORE/X server, and by XUUDB
administrators (who usually use the XUUDB certificate).

An access control list (ACL) is used to control which DNs are allowed
to edit the XUUDB.

Relevant configuration files:

The keystore/truststore is configured in 
"xuudb/conf/xuudb_server.conf"

The DNs that are allowed to edit the XUUDB are controlled in 
"xuudb/conf/xuudb.acl"

Required Truststore content:

 - CA certificates of all UNICORE/X, Workflow etc servers accessing the XUUDB
 - CA certificates of the XUUDB administrators
