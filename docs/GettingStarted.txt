Getting started with the UNICORE Server Bundle
**********************************************

WHERE TO GET MORE DOCUMENTATION
*******************************

Have a look at https://unicore-docs.readthedocs.io


SERVER STARTUP
**************

There's a "start.sh" script that starts up the installed components.


USAGE
*****

Clients are available from the UNICORE download page
https://www.unicore.eu/downloads

** Security: 

The "demouser" account with password "test123" will give you access
to the REST API (directly or via the UCC commandline client).


If you want to use user certificates (not recommended), there is a
"Demo User" certificate available for testing:

keystore  : certs/demouser.p12 (password is 'the!user')
public key: certs/demouser.pem
Signing CA: certs/trusted/cacert.pem

The client-side security setup depends on the type of client you
are using. For detailed instructions, we refer you to the security
guides available on the UNICORE web site https://www.unicore.eu/documentation
and on the UNICORE Wiki https://sourceforge.net/p/unicore/wiki/

** Client side registry settings:

In the client, edit the registry settings 
to include the UNICORE Registry:

https://host:port/REGISTRY/rest/registries/default_registry

or

https://host:port/DEMO-SITE/rest/registries/default_registry
   

if you did not install the shared registry

Here, "host" and "port" refer to the gateway hostname and port (8080 by
default).


ADMINISTRATION NOTES
********************

** Security notes (UNIX systems):

It is NOT necessary (and NOT advisable) to run the servers with administrator
privileges. An exception is the UNICORE TSI server, which must be started as root,
if you want to run UNICORE in a multiuser setting.


** Persistence:

UNICORE/X (and Workflow and Registry) servers stores state
persistently, by default using an embedded database. In case of
problems it may be required to purge the directory used for storage
(default: unicorex/data, registry/data, workflow/data) This is
especially the case if you change fundamental server settings such as
host names, ports, certificates, etc.

** Using a Batch system:

To use a batch system such as Slurm, or even to run jobs on a machine
that is not the UNICORE/X server. you need to install and configure
the UNICORE TSI.

** Memory usage

The servers keeps most of the data on disk (or in the configured
database), but still load services into memory when they are used. You
can configure the amount of memory allocated to UNICORE/X in
the ".../conf/startup.properties" file(s)


** Limiting memory usage

You can set a limit on the number of service instances (e.g. jobs) per user.
This allows you to make sure your server stays nicely up and running even if 
flooded by jobs. Please see the UNICORE/X manual for details.

** Logging:
Logging levels, files, etc can be set in the
"<component>/conf/logging.properties" files

No restart of the component is needed, the changes will take effect
after a few seconds.
