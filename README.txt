UNICORE Core Server Bundle
**************************

This includes the following UNICORE server components:

- Gateway
- UNICORE/X
- TSI
- Registry
- Workflow
- XUUDB

Java 11 or later is required. We recommend using OpenJDK.
IBM Java has been reported to work as well.

Python 3.x is required for the TSI and for using the installation
helper scripts.


SEE the 'INSTALL.md' file for installation instructions.


UNICORE clients are available separately, for example the UNICORE
Commandline Client (UCC), which can be downloaded from SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/unicore/files/Clients/Commandline%20Client

PLEASE NOTE: We are always interested in feedback, i.e. where and in
which context UNICORE is used, and if there is something you would
need or like to see in future releases. Feel free to contact us via
one of the channels below.
